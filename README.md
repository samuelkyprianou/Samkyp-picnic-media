# Picnic Tech Test

Hi! Thank you for taking the time to complete our tech test. We hope it's a fun & interesting activity.

This should take 1-2 hours, we don't want to take too much of your time, so please note down if you've got to a certain point by then & we will take that into consideration.

Good luck!

## The Test

The test is to add a sort or filter to a table. It can be any sort, it can be any filter. BUT, you _shouldn't use any third-party tools_ to help you.

Please document your work, in the form of comments. Sometimes it's less about the code iteself, and more about the motivation behind the code.

We've provided the API data for you, so there shouldn't be any issue with populating a table with data.

We have no preference on styles, add as much or as little as you would like, the test is more about the implementation of the table and filter/sort.

This is a test of your knowledge across React, Javascript and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo & call it something unique, using the button in the top right corner. You shouldn't need to create a codesandbox profile.
2. We've provided you with some basic react app starter code as this is not a test of your ability to set up a project from scratch.
3. Add your table component & make sure it renders the API data fetched in `App.tsx` (you don't have to include all the data, just include what you like & a column that can be filtered/sorted)
4. Add your filter or sort
5. If you have time we'd love you to add some testing to the tests folder. We've installed Jest and React Testing Library already but feel free to install and use something else. CodeSandbox runs tests automatically in the 'Tests' tab
6. Please reply to our email with a link to your code
